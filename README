RETAIL(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                RETAIL(1)

NAME
     retail -- display the additions to a file since previous retail run

SYNOPSIS
     retail [-o datafile] file

DESCRIPTION
     The retail utility displays the lines added to a file since the last run
     to stdout.

     After each run, the retail utility stores the most recent size, byte off-
     set and inode of the file.  By default, this information is stored in the
     same directory as the file with the name ``offset.'' plus the log file
     name.

     The utility accepts one option:

     -b datafile
          The datafile stores the size, offset and inode information about the
          retail run.  There is one datafile per file being retailed.  If the
          given datafile ends in a forward slash, then retail stores the
          datafile in that directory, using the default file name described
          above.

     In some cases, retail will notice that the file has been rotated and tail
     the rotated file before tailing the current file.

     Specifically, if the inode of the file is unchanged and the file is
     smaller, retail assumes the file was rotated via a copy and truncate.
     The utility looks for files (in the same directory) that match the file
     name and takes the most recently modified one.  For example, if the file
     name is ``syslog'', and the same directory has the files ``syslog.1'' and
     ``syslog.2'', retail will assume the most recently modified of the two is
     the rotated log.

     If the inode is different, retail assumes the file was rotated via a move
     and recreate, and looks for a file with the old inode.  If it can't find
     one, retail assumes the old file was gzipped after the move and looks for
     the most recently changed file in the same directory with a name that
     starts with the log file name and ends with ``.gz''.  The logic is the
     same as the example above, but only files that end in ``.gz'' are consid-
     ered.

EXIT STATUS
     The retail utility returns 0 on success and 1 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To retail syslog and store the offset information in
     ``/var/db/retail/offset.syslog''.

           $ retail -o /var/db/retail/ /var/log/syslog

HISTORY
     Initially published by Craig H. Rowland in 1996, who was inspired by the
     retail utility in the Gauntlet(TM) firewall protection package, which was
     sold by Trusted Information Systems.
